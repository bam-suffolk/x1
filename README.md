# x1:  Lights, Camera, Action !
Create a scene plus some action for your creature.

SCENE:    Design a "scene" with sky, sun, grass, and a few other features such as a tree and a house.

CREATURE:  
* Design your own "creature" (and give it a better name than "Zoog").
* Use at least three different shapes and colors for your creature.
* Also display its name in a contrasting color.

ACTION:  The creature should move as follows:
* Use the variables x and y for the location of your creature.
* Start in the middle of the window.
* Move in each frame by adding "dx" and "dy" to the coordinates (x,y).

MOUSE CLICK:
* When mouse is clicked, change x and y to the mouse coordinates (mouseX,mouseY), and 
* Set dx and dy to random values.

MODIFY the "starter" code in the "x1.java" file to redraw your scene in each frame, make your creature move as described, and show it at the new coordinates (x,y).
